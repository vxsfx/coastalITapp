requires
1)accellarometer
    -->for rotation
2)geo caching
    -->getting local location
3)geo location
    -->access location of user
        -->use to locate nearby geo caches
4)barcode scanning
    -->barcode stickers
5)uses files
    -->???


ideas
-->barcodes scanned once(ever,per day)??
-->potential problem(barcode vandalism)
1)excersise app, scan barcode, run to next, measure time taken,get ditance
    -->green scheme
2)marclicker app, button for score, scan barcodes for multiplier,
    -->market like colours
3)treasure hunt maker
    -->design and place caches, map location.
        -->join up code??
        -->use pre produced barcodes
4)pirate tycoon
    -->barcodes for multiplier
        -->more barcodes located near coast
    -->purchase auto clickers (pirates)

idea going forward
-->pirate clicker
    -->crew and ships limiting factors
        -->crew for speed
        -->ships for amount in weight
            -->ship number depends on crew size
    -->cargo types different value and weight
        -->limited time special cargo for scanning special locations
    -->pirate battle other players???
        -->gain ships defeated, lose ships lost
            -->only gained if equal class or greater
        -->flag ship in centre
            -->flag ship can be upgraded for battles
        -->defeat ship get next turn
    -->upgrade shop
        -->larger ship class(more hp,dmg,weight allowed)
        -->other upgrades
